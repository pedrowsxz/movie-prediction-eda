    "This notebook provides a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a movie dataset, utilized within the context of a data science project. The analysis is designed to uncover key insights and patterns within the data, followed by a series of relevant questions to deepen understanding. The project will conclude with the development of a predictive model\n",

To achieve this, hypotheses will be formulated and subsequently tested through data analysis and visualizations.I will generate some hypothesis, then they will be tested by data and visualizations.\n",

    "Answering the question, what drives the box office in this dataset are these factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reach/awareness (No_of_Votes) is the clearest driver. Marketing scale, distribution breadth, and franchise fandom matter most.\n",
    "- Commercial genres (Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi) are associated with higher revenue—broad appeal + effects + franchiseability.\n",
    "- Proven directors and top-billed stars correlate with higher grosses—likely because they attract budgets, marketing, and global releases.\n",
    "- Release year / market scale helps (inflation, global box office)—but the effect is second-order after popularity.\n",
    "- Ratings and runtime have weak direct links; great movies can underperform commercially and vice-versa."

    "#### Answering the Question\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Overview column provides a textual summary of each movie, describing its plot, characters, setting, and main events. By analyzing the most frequent words in the overviews for the top 10 genres, we can identify common themes and elements associated with each genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example:\n",
    "    - Drama: Words like young, man, life, world, story, family indicate that drama movies often focus on human relationships, personal struggles, and life events.\n",
    "    - Comedy: Words like friends, funny, school, girl, family suggest humorous, lighthearted situations often centered on social interactions.\n",
    "    - Crime: Words like murder, police, killer, crime, investigation point to themes of law, criminal activity, and suspense.\n",
    "    - Adventure / Action: Words such as war, journey, team, save, battle show that these movies involve quests, conflict, and high-stakes scenarios.\n",
    "    - Romance: Words like love, woman, man, falls, friendship highlight relationship-focused plots.\n",
    "    - Animation: Words like princess, toy, home, friends, quest indicate family-friendly, imaginative stories.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    These frequent words summarize the core themes, characters, and plot elements in each genre and highlight the distinct “signature vocabulary” of different types of movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Can Genre Be Inferred from the Overview?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Yes. The analysis shows that each genre has distinctive keywords that appear repeatedly in its overviews, crime movies consistently mention words related to law, murder, and investigation, romance and drama frequently contain words about love, family, and relationships, adventure and action contain words about journeys, battles, or missions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This implies that it is possible to infer the genre from the overview, at least to some extent. A text-based model (like a bag-of-words or TF-IDF classifier) could be trained on these overviews to predict genres, especially for genres with strong thematic vocabulary.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    By analyzing frequent words, we can identify the genre with reasonable accuracy and gain insights into the plot structure, character focus, and typical story elements for each type of movie."

    "**Comparison**\n",
    "- While **HistGradientBoostingRegressor** is more scalable and efficient, in this dataset the classic **GradientBoostingRegressor** achieved better predictive performance, with a notably higher R² (0.534 vs. 0.388) and slightly lower RMSE (0.197 vs. 0.200).\n",
    "- This difference may be explained by the relatively small dataset size, where the efficiency advantages of histogram-based methods are less relevant, and the more traditional boosting approach benefits from deeper optimization.\n",
    "- Both models show reasonable predictive power, but **GradientBoostingRegressor currently provides the best fit** for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**  \n",
    "By testing multiple boosting approaches, I was able to confirm that ensemble methods outperform simpler baselines for predicting IMDb scores. GradientBoostingRegressor will be kept as the primary model, while HistGradientBoostingRegressor remains a strong alternative for larger datasets or scenarios requiring faster training."

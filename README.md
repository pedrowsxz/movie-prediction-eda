# Movie Analytics & Predictive Modeling

This project is part of a business and data science challenge.  
It focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **predictive modeling**, and **statistical reasoning** to understand the factors driving movie success and IMDb ratings.

##  Description

**Perform EDA** to explore the main characteristics of the dataset, testing hypotheses, and identifying relevant correlations.  
**Modeling IMDb Score**:  
   - Define the problem type (regression).  
   - Choose features and transformations.  
   - Train and evaluate multiple models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).  
   - Select the best model and save it as `.pkl`.  
**Prediction Example**: Estimate the IMDb rating of an example row, given its details.

## Installation

- Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-prediction-eda.git
cd movie-prediction-eda
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

1. Open Jupyter Lab or Notebook:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

2. Run the analysis notebook:
- EDA.ipynb

The trained models are saved in the .pkl files.
